1. Business Logic
	-check usernames against existing usernames
	-reject any duplicates
	-model for this: rejecting bad characters in input
2. Client-Side Data
	-keep this server side!
	-each request to server should include valid cookie id which should be matched to correct user
3. CSRF
	-CSRF token! hidden POST value
	-SameSite cookies to strict - might be annoying but would help
	-referer header would be a huge one
	-re-login to change user data! (this seems very relevant to editing profile/username, less important for comments):
4. XSS
	-clearly the website removes "script" from comments, so if we expand this to inclde variants like "SCRIPT" this will work
	-fixing the csrf vulnerability would help here too (but you can still do attacks without csrf).
5. File Upload
	-better parsing of files
	-check last 4 chars of filename are ".pdf"
	-could also reject any files with ".php" or similar
