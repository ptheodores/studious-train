Collaboration statement: I used only the resources in the wiki + TA hours to complete this assignment

My attacks that use deliverables:
1. Business logic
	-change username to an already existing account (e.g. bernardo)
	-NO DELIVERABLES
2. Client Hidden Sensitive Data
	-http://34.135.19.82/handins
	-you can get access to literally any handin
	-I verify this by uploading a pdf to someone else's account
	-NO DELIVERABLES
3. CSRF
	-use csrf.html (which could be sent in a phishing scam)
	-this will change username/profile pic/bio if a logged in user clicks it
	-DELIVERABLES:
		-csrf.html
4. XSS
	-This builds on the CSRF vulnerability which I uncovered earlier
	-While a user is logged in, get them to visit the website/file xsscsrf.html
	-This replaces their username with a script which redirects users to a webpage
	-Specifically, if bernardo reaches into this webpage, an assignment gets deleted
	-DELIVERABLES:
		-xsscsrf.html
5. File-Upload 
	-Upload file
	-Navigate to file and input using ?cmd! You now run a shell on the website
	-DELIVERABLES:
		-shell.pdf.php (file to upload)
		-shell-cmd.txt (example of a destructive cmd to input)

NO VIDEO DEMO - I'm meeting with a TA!
