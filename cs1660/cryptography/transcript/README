* My attack involves converting my transcript to hex,  and then submitting this hex fileto the challenge protocol. I then take the output of this challenge protocol, and use this as the signature for transcript. The reason why this works is that the encryption protocol is symmetric. When I submit the hex version to the challenge protol, it decrypts with the private key. When I use this output as the signature and verify the transcript, it decrypts the signature using the public key. Because the signature is just the message decrypted using the private key, and the public key undoes the decryption, the verification sees that this message matches the original transcript and thus is valid.

* The vulnerability is that I have access the private key's decryption by use of the challenge protocol. If the website connection used a different RSA key, then I couldn't use the challenge protocol to encrypt the transcript. My attack wouldn't work at all.

* I propose using two difference keys for the two different RSA operations. To defeat this, the attacker would need to find another way to gain access to the private key, or they would have to guess the private key, either of which would be very hard to do.
